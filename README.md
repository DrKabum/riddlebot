# riddlebot

An attempt to use the Github API [RiddleBot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/riddlebot) and trying to make it fun. This time it's a full React project, too. The objectives were to use compound components and the [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) library.
